    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook: In a large pot or dutch oven, add chicken thighs, 
            tomatillos, onion, jalapeños, garlic, oregano, salt, and broth. 
            Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce heat to low, cover partially, 
            and simmer for 40 minutes until chicken is fall-apart tender.</li>
        <li>Shred: Transfer chicken to cutting board and shred with a fork. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Blend: Using a large slotted spoon, carefully transfer the cooked tomatillos, 
            onions, jalapenos, and garlic to a large blender. Add in a cup of the cooking liquid 
            and the cilantro, and blend until completely smooth.</li>
        <li>Simmer: Pour the blended mixture back into the pot and stir in the shredded chicken 
            and hominy. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat and cook uncovered for 15 minutes. 
            Taste and season with more salt, if necessary.</li>
